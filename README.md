# Pentago (Python)

A university project done as part of a programming module.
As an interest, I have modified it by creating an interface and will continue to improve the overall code structure.

In the pentago.py file, the core functions are:

1) check_turn - check's the validity of the current turn [game must always start with player 1].
Input board and turn, Output true/false

2) rotation - rotates one of four 3x3 quadrant of the board once, either clockwise of anti-clockwise.
Input board and rot, Output board
