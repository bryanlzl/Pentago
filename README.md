A university project on creating a game called Pentago. Pentago is an abstract strategy game created by Tomas Flod√©n.
Game is similar to connect 4, but requires 5 rows of the same color to win
As an interest, I have modified it by creating an interface and will continue to improve the overall code structure

### Features:
- A semi-functional display interface for the game using Tkinter GUI
- Human vs AI, Human vs Human and AI vs AI mode
- AI level 0 makes completely random moves
- AI level 1 prevents opponent from any direct wins in the next move via an exhaustive search of all possible combinations and permutations (brute force method)

### Instructions:
1) Download pentago.py
2) Run pentago.py
3) Follow menu instructions in the run terminal accordingly
